Hi, I am Mahmud Ridwan.

I started [my career](https://hjr265.me/experience/) in the industry as a remote freelance software developer in 2010. I completed my B. Sc. in Computer Science at the end of 2012. During my years in academia, I fell in love with competitive programming.

I started [Furqan Software](https://furqansoftware.com/) in 2015 and turned my pet project into [Toph](https://toph.co/). Today, Toph is the leading competitive programming platform in Bangladesh.

I like free (as in freedom) software, and [I enjoy making them](https://hjr265.me/open-source/).
